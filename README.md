The Firetail AppSync Lambda recieves Cloudwatch log events from AppSync APIs, and forwards request and response data to the Firetail SaaS.



## Tests

Tests can be run with the standard `go test` command. [stretchr/testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) has been used for shorthand assertions. 

A [Makefile](./Makefile) is provided which is used by [this GitHub action](./.github/workflows/codecov.yml) to upload coverage reports to Codecov. The Makefile can be used to generate the same coverage report locally, which you can then view in your browser using `go tool cover`:

```bash
make test
go tool cover -html coverage.out
```



## Deployment

1. [Install prerequisites](#installing-prerequisites)
2. [Configure the AppSync app's Cloudwatch logs](#configuring-appsync)
3. [Generate a Firetail API token](#generating-a-firetail-api-token)
4. [Build the Firetail AppSync Lambda](#building-the-firetail-appsync-lambda)
5. [Deploy the Firetail AppSync Lambda with Serverless](#deploying-the-firetail-appsync-lambda-with-serverless)



### Installing prerequisites

Building and deploying the Firetail AppSync Lambda requires the following prerequisites:

- A Go installation - see the [Download and Install instructions at go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- The Serverless CLI - see [Setting Up Serverless Framework With AWS at serverless.com](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started)
- An account and organisation on the Firetail SaaS - visit [firetail.app](https://firetail.app) to get started



### Configuring AppSync

Before deploying the Firetail AppSync Lambda, ensure the AppSync app is configured to log to Cloudwatch. The corresponding [AWS documentation can be found here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/monitoring.html).

It is recommended to:

- Enable **Include verbose content**
- Set the **Field resolver log level** to **All**

üìù Take note of the name of the log group for the AppSync app, as this will be required when deploying the Firetail AppSync Lambda.



### Generating a Firetail API Token

In order to deploy the Firetail AppSync Lambda, an API token from the Firetail SaaS is required. Documentation on how to obtain a Firetail API token from the Firetail SaaS can be found [here](). #TODO

üìù Take note of the Firetail API token, as this will be required when deploying the Firetail AppSync Lambda.



### Building the Firetail AppSync Lambda

The Firetail AppSync Lambda is written in Go, and can be built using the standard `go build` command. First, clone the repository and change directory into `logs-handler`, where the Lambda's source is located:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:FireTail-io/firetail-appsync-lambda.git
cd firetail-appsync-lambda/logs-hander
```

Before building the source into a binary, set `GOARCH` to `amd64` and `GOOS` to `linux` to ensure the binary will be compatible with the [Lambda Go runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html):

```bash
GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=linux
```

Next, build the binary and output it into a `bin` directory at the root of the repository. `-ldflags="-s -w"` can be used to marginally reduce the size of the binary:

```bash
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o ../bin/logs-handler
```

A [serverless.yml](./serverless.yml) is provided in the root of this repository which can be used to deploy this binary to Lambda, and expects the binary to be found in a `bin` directory at the root of the repository, hence `-o ../bin/logs-handler`.



### Deploying the Firetail AppSync Lambda with Serverless

A [serverless.yml](./serverless.yml) is provided in the root of this repository, which has two parameters:

1. `firetail-api-token`, an API token for the Firetail Logs API.
2. `cloudwatch-log-group`, the log group for an AppSync API in Cloudwatch.

Given these two values, the Lambda can be deployed by running the following serverless command from the root of the repository:

```bash
sls deploy --param="firetail-api-token=YOUR_FIRETAIL_API_TOKEN" --param="cloudwatch-log-group=YOUR_CLOUDWATCH_LOG_GROUP"
```

This serverless command may require additional flags depending upon the use case, for example to specify the region in which the Lambda should be deployed. See `sls deploy --help` for a list of available flags.
